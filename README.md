eVoting Platform by Team Elevate at Preambly Hackton 2022

Introduction
Over the years, Nigeria has been desirous of a credible voting system due to the irregularities that hampered previous elections which include: ballot stuffing, intimidation of voters, hijacking of ballot boxes, violence, and manipulation of election results. Hence, the independent national electoral commission introduced direct data capture machine technology in 2007 which produced the electronic voter’s register and smart card readers which have since been used for all elections. Though the introduction of the electronic voter registers and smart card readers improved the electoral process, research reveals that it is yet, to achieve the desired results. 
Problem
Election is central to the existence, stability and development of democracy in any country. Therefore, the electoral system of a government determines the political growth and democratic stability of that society. In Nigeria, the agency charged with the conduct and supervision of elections is the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), empowered by the 1999 constitution to conduct a free and fair election. Three methods of voting have been used, so far, in Nigeria. These are Open Ballot System (OBS), Modified Open Ballot System (MOBS) and Re-modified Open-secret Ballot System (REMOBS). Open Ballot System (OBS). However, the system still needs to be able to resolve the critical issue with Nigerian elections. Therefore, developing a mechanism that validates citizens before elections is crucial. It is imperative that we devise a mechanism that would make voting easier for citizens, enhance security, and eradicate corruption. E-vote is an electronic voting platform that authenticates and verifies users (through identitpass) to be able to vote for their choosen aspirants. The users also have access to interact with the concerned authority like government by sending reports or complaints on the platform.

Our Roadmap
We started our journey by researching to understand the current platform provided by INEC to better understand the election process and to have a better understanding. We made use of both primary and secondary to collect our data. After that, data we got were used in coming up with a design. Our frontend developer implemented the design and pushed to github which our backend took over from him.
